-- This used to crash because we were not considering proof erasure when determining a rewrite's
-- mvars, which resulted in allowed directions for rewrites which should not have been valid. As a
-- result the calls to `union_instantiations` in the `LeanApplier` would crash, because the
-- substitution resulting from e-matching was incomplete.
