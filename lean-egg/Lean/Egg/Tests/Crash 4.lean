-- This used to fail because we were not considering proof mvars when refreshing a rewrite's mvars.
-- As a result, rewrites produced by type class specialization could contain unrefreshed mvars for
-- proof terms (and their types). These did not affect the computation of valid directions, but did
-- affect the encoding of erased proofs which then contained mvars which should have been assigned
-- by type class specialization. As a result, `union_instantiations` would crash with the
-- substitution lacking an assignment for the pattern variable corresponding to the non-refreshed
-- proof mvar.
